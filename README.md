# Graphics
Problems for the Graphics subject (G) using OpenGL. Done in Q2 2023-24 (February 2024 - June 2024).

Features: 
- Vertex and fragment shaders (mainly Lab1-Lab4)
- Geometry shaders (Lab7) 
- Plugins/other effects that require C++ code (Lab8-Lab11). This part uses some code from the [ViRVIG viewer](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~virtual/G/index.php?dir=2.%20Laboratori/viewer/).
